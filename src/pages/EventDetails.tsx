    title: "Community Health Workshop",
    describtion: 'Yesterday December 22, 2023, KELLENA, in collaboration with the Jang Health Center in Tabenken village, Donga Mantung Division of Nkambe Central, organized a health talk aimed at raising awareness on child protection and addressing gender-based violence (GBV). The initiative targeted over 100 nursing mothers during their pre and postnatal visits at the clinic, as well as community members through sensitization efforts in all six quarters of Tabenken.Child Protection Awareness:The health talk emphasized the universal rights of children, including the right to a name, good health, education, and a birth certificate. Parents were reminded that failing to respect these rights constitutes an abuse of children\'s rights. The session aimed to empower parents with the knowledge and understanding of their responsibilities in ensuring the well-being of their children.Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Awareness:Participants were enlightened about the prevalence of GBV, emphasizing that it is not exclusive to one gender. Both women and men were acknowledged as potential victims or perpetrators of GBV, encompassing emotional and psychological abuse. Attendees were encouraged to report cases of GBV and seek protection from KELLENA\'s focal point in Tabenken for appropriate intervention.Acknowledgments:Much appreciation was expressed to the Jang Health Center manager and her team for their outstanding efforts in facilitating a successful end-of-year health talk with KELLENA Association in Tabenken village. The collaborative endeavor contributed significantly to the overall well-being of the community members.',
